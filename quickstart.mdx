description: "Start building your first Speech-to-Speech Voice AI Agent with AIVOCO"
---


Welcome — this quickstart will get you up and running with **ROSE**, AIVOCO’s real-time Speech-to-Speech (S2S) model, in three simple steps.

> **Goal:** Create a voice AI agent, connect it to live audio (web or telephony), and capture transcriptions.

---

## Step 1 — Get your API key

1. Sign in to the AIVOCO Playground: `https://playground.aivoco.com`  
2. Open **Dashboard → API Keys** and generate (or copy) your API key.  
3. Keep the key secure — do not publish it.

> You will use this API key to authenticate both HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.

---

## Step 2 — Create your Agent

Create a new Speech-to-Speech agent using the **Create Agent** docs.

- Follow: [Create Agent](/api-reference/endpoint/create)  
- Provide a `name`, a `system_message` that defines the agent persona, and a `voice` (`boy` or `girl`).  
- Optionally add `functions` to enable function-calling behavior from the agent.

When created, note the returned **agent_id** — you will need it to connect your WebSocket session.

---

## Step 3 — Connect via WebSocket (Web or Telephony)

Use our WebSocket endpoint to stream audio bi-directionally with ROSE. This is the same mechanism whether you connect from a browser app or bridge an external telephony provider.

**WebSocket URL (example):**

```
wss://call.aivoco.on.cloud.wispok.in/ws/{API_KEY}/{AGENT_ID}
```

Replace `{API_KEY}` and `{AGENT_ID}` with your values from Step 1 and Step 2.

Once connected you can:
- Send audio frames (client → ROSE)
- Receive synthesized audio responses (ROSE → client)
- Maintain session context for multi-turn conversations

---

## Transcription (After the Call)

After a call ends you can obtain a transcription using the Transcription endpoint (see the Transcription docs). The typical flow is:

1. Make your call (web or telephony) to the agent connected to ROSE.  
2. Note the `call_id` returned or available in your call logs.  
3. Use the Transcription API to fetch the text transcript for that `call_id`.

See: [Transcribe Audio](/api-reference/endpoint/transcription)

## Tips & Notes

- Use the Playground to test agents interactively before wiring production telephony.  
- If your telephony provider isn't supported out of the box, contact us at <a href="mailto:aivocofounders@gmail.com">aivocofounders@gmail.com</a>.  
- Protect your API key — treat it like a password.
