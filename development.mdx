---


Welcome to the **AIVOCO Development Guide** — your reference for building, testing, and scaling **speech-to-speech (S2S) voice agents** powered by the **ROSE** model.

---

## Local Development Setup

Before you start coding, ensure that you’ve completed the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide.

You’ll need:

- Your **API key** from [playground.aivoco.com](https://playground.aivoco.com)
- An **Agent ID** created using the [Create Agent](/api-reference/agents/create) endpoint
- Access to the **WebSocket URL** to connect your speech agent

---

## WebSocket Connection

The ROSE model communicates in real time over WebSocket.

To connect your application:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://call.aivoco.on.cloud.vispark.in/ws/{api_key}/{agent_id}");

ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log("Connected to ROSE agent");
  // Start sending or receiving audio data here
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log("Received audio or transcript:", event.data);
};

ws.onclose = () => console.log("Connection closed");
````

This WebSocket stream enables **real-time bi-directional audio** between your system and the ROSE model.

---

## Agent Lifecycle

You can manage your voice agents through the REST API. Common operations include:

| Action       | Endpoint                                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Create Agent | [`POST /agents`](/api-reference/endpoint/create)        |
| Get Agent    | [`GET /agents/{id}`](/api-reference/endpoint/get)       |
| Update Agent | [`PUT /agents/{id}`](/api-reference/endpoint/update)    |
| Delete Agent | [`DELETE /agents/{id}`](/api-reference/endpoint/delete) |

Each operation allows you to programmatically manage agent configuration, personalities, voices, and function calling capabilities.

---

## Connecting with Telephony

To use your agent for **voice calls**, connect the WebSocket endpoint to your telephony provider.
We provide an example integration with **Twilio** in [Outbound Telephony Integration](/telephony/outbound), but you can use **any telephony system** that supports audio streaming.

If your preferred provider is not listed, you can reach out at
[📧 tanusri@aivoco.com](mailto:tanusri@aivoco.com) for custom integration support.

## Testing and Debugging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="bug" title="Testing locally">
    You can test your agents using the ROSE WebSocket without deploying to production.  
    Simply connect using your API key and agent ID from the playground.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="waveform" title="Audio debugging">
    Record incoming and outgoing audio locally to verify audio stream quality.  
    Use tools like `ffmpeg` or `sox` to capture and inspect audio packets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code" title="Inspecting responses">
    The WebSocket will send both audio and transcript events.  
    Log all message events in your client for better observability.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Retrieving Transcriptions

After your calls are completed, you can retrieve full conversation transcripts using the
[`GET /transcriptions/{call_id}`](/api-reference/transcriptions/get) endpoint.

This allows you to analyze and store the conversation context for your business logic or analytics layer.

---

## Next Steps

* Build and deploy your own ROSE voice agent
* Connect with your telephony or VoIP system
* Retrieve and analyze transcripts
* Launch your AI-powered conversations
