description: " The Inbound URL allows telephony platforms to seamlessly route incoming calls directly into the ROSE Speech-to-Speech (S2S) system.   We’ve built a universal endpoint that supports configuration for multiple telephony providers  meaning you can connect your existing setup (Twilio, Telnyx, Exotel, etc.) with ROSE without custom adapters."

# Inbound Telephony Integration

ROSE supports real-time **speech-to-speech** communication via WebSocket connections, allowing seamless integration with leading telephony providers.

As our Speech-to-Speech model supports WebSocket integration, it can **natively connect with multiple telephony platforms** to receive live inbound calls and route them directly to an AIvoco Agent.

---

## 🔗 Inbound URL Format

Use the following endpoint to connect your inbound call flow to ROSE:

```
https://call.aivoco.on.cloud.vispark.in/inbound?api_key=YOUR_KEY&agent_id=AGENT_ID&provider=PROVIDER_NAME
```

Replace:

- `YOUR_KEY` → your AIvoco API key
- `AGENT_ID` → the UUID or ID of your registered speech agent
- `PROVIDER_NAME` → one of the supported telephony partners

---

## Supported Telephony Providers

ROSE seamlessly integrates with the following telephony platforms:

- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us)
- [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com/)
- [Exotel](https://exotel.com/)
- [Vonage](https://www.vonage.com/)
- [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/)
- [Bandwidth](https://dev.bandwidth.com/)
- [SignalWire](https://signalwire.com/)
- [MessageBird](https://developers.messagebird.com/)

Each provider can use the same **inbound URL** format with their own webhook or call forwarding setup.

If your required telephony provider isn’t available, please reach out to us at 
<a href="mailto:aivocofounders@gmail.com">aivocofounders@gmail.com</a> and we’ll be happy to help you integrate it.

## ⚙️ Example

For a Telnyx connection:

```
url*&provider=telnyx**
```

```
https://call.aivoco.on.cloud.vispark.in/inbound?api_key=abc123&agent_id=789xyz&provider=telnyx
```

The ROSE model automatically establishes a **WebSocket session** between your agent and the telephony audio stream, enabling full-duplex real-time conversation.
