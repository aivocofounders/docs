# Outbound Telephony Integration (Twilio & Custom Providers)

Our speech-to-speech model can connect directly to telephony systems to make **outbound calls**. Using **Twilio** or your own telephony infrastructure, you can stream audio bi-directionally between a phone call and our **ROSE WebSocket**, enabling real-time, human-like voice AI interactions.

## How It Works

Telephony platforms like **Twilio**, **Telnyx**, or **Exotel** support **bi-directional media streaming**, allowing live audio from a phone call to be sent and received in real time via WebSocket.

Our **ROSE WebSocket endpoint** is designed to handle this exact flow — receiving live human speech and responding instantly with generated speech output.

In this example, we’ll use **Twilio** to initiate an outbound call and connect it to the ROSE WebSocket.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **telephony provider** account (Telnyx, Exotel or others)  
- Your **ROSE API Key** and **Agent ID** from the [AIVOCO Playground](https://playground.aivoco.com)

---

## Example: Outbound Call with Twilio

```python
from twilio.rest import Client as TwilioClient

# Twilio credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = "<your_account_sid>"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = "<your_auth_token>"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = "+121336763"  # Your Twilio phone number

# ROSE Agent credentials
agent_id = "<your_agent_id>"
api_key = "<your_api_key>"

# Recipient phone number
phone_number = "+91XXXXXXXXXX"

# WebSocket URL for streaming
websocket_url = f"wss://call.aivoco.on.cloud.vispark.in/ws/{api_key}/{agent_id}"

# TwiML response defining the media stream
twiml_content = f"""<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Connect>
    <Stream url="{websocket_url}" />
  </Connect>
  <Pause length="3600"/>
</Response>"""

# Initialize Twilio client
twilio_client = TwilioClient(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Start outbound call
call = twilio_client.calls.create(
    twiml=twiml_content,
    to=phone_number,
    from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
)

print(f"Call started: {call.sid}")
````

## Using Other Telephony Providers

our **ROSE WebSocket API** works with **any telephony provider** that supports live media streaming via Websockets.

To connect your telephony platform:

1. Generate your **API Key** and **Agent ID** from the [AIVOCO Playground](https://playground.aivoco.com).

2. Connect your telephony system to the WebSocket endpoint below:

   ```
   wss://call.aivoco.on.cloud.vispark.in/ws/{api_key}/{agent_id}
   ```

3. Send and receive live audio streams to and from ROSE using your provider’s streaming API.

4. Once connected, the ROSE model will handle real-time speech understanding and generation.

**Tip:** You can easily replace your exisitng WebSocket endpoint with our websockts both **outbound** and **inbound** call flows.

---

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

**1. Invalid credentials:**
Double-check your Twilio/telephony credentials and ROSE API key.

**2. Call connects but no audio:**
Ensure your WebSocket endpoint is reachable and supports bi-directional audio.

**3. Call not initiating:**
Your telephony number must be verified (for trial or restricted accounts).

**4. Test locally:**
Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel your WebSocket or HTTP endpoints for local testing.

---

## Next Steps

* Replace placeholders (`api_key`, `agent_id`, and telephony credentials`) in your code.
* Run the script to initiate a live outbound call.
* Experience a real-time voice conversation with your **ROSE Voice Agent**.
