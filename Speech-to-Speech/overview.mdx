# 🌹 ROSE: Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Model

## Overview

**ROSE** is AIvoco’s flagship **Speech-to-Speech (S2S)** model — a real-time, human-like conversational AI capable of listening, thinking, and responding in natural speech.  
It enables developers to build **voice agents** that sound alive, understand context, and adapt dynamically during a conversation.

ROSE is optimized for **telephony**, **voice automation**, **interactive agents**, and **AI-driven customer experiences**.  
It supports **real-time bi-directional streaming**, **agent customization**, **transcription**, and **function calling**.

##  API Endpoints

| Type | Endpoint | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **WebSocket** | `wss://call.aivoco.on.cloud.vispark.in/ws/{api_key}/{agent_uuid}` | Real-time speech-to-speech connection |
| **Agents API** | `/agents` | Create, list, and manage S2S agents |
| **Telephony API** | `/telephony/*` | Connect ROSE to inbound/outbound calls |
| **Transcription API** | `/transcription` | Real-time or batch transcription |
| **Function Calling API** | `/functions/*` | Register or call external functions |

---

##  Getting Started

### Step 1 — Create an Agent
Define an agent persona using the **Agents API**.

```bash
POST /agents
{
  "name": "Rose Assistant",
  "system_message": "You are a friendly, conversational assistant.",
  "voice": "girl"
}
```

### Step 2 — Start a Connection
Connect to the WebSocket for real-time voice streaming.

```bash
wss://call.aivoco.on.cloud.vispark.in/ws/YOUR_API_KEY/AGENT_UUID
```

### Step 3 — Stream Audio
- Send base64-encoded audio chunks
- Receive real-time audio responses
- Maintain session state and context

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Call Center Automation** — AI answering and handling customer calls  
- **Voice Companions** — Human-like interactive personalities  
- **Voice-to-Voice Translation** — Speak and get responses in another language  
- **Sales Assistants** — Outbound calling agents for leads and appointments  
- **Smart IVR Systems** — Dynamic, conversational phone menus

---

## Model Behavior and Persona Control

ROSE adapts based on the **system message** of its agent.  
For example:

> "You are a helpful and empathetic customer support representative."  
> "You are a witty, confident sales assistant who loves closing deals."

This allows developers to tailor the **tone, personality, and conversational depth** of their AI voice.

---

## Notes

- ROSE is currently available for **real-time streaming** and **telephony** use cases.  
- Requires an active **API key** and **sufficient credits**.  
- Supported voices: `{boy, girl}` (more coming soon).  
- For telephony integration, see `telephony.md` under this folder.
