<Note>
  Welcome to the **Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Agent Creation API**, powered by our model **ROSE**.  
  If you're building human-like voice AI agents that can listen, think, and respond naturally, you're in the right place.
</Note>

## Welcome

Meet **ROSE**, our real-time **Speech-to-Speech model** built for next-generation voice AI agents.  
Unlike traditional text-based systems, ROSE allows direct **voice-to-voice interaction**, enabling agents that sound expressive, react instantly, and feel more human.  

This documentation will guide you through every step of building your own **voice AI agent**, from creation to live interaction.

## Getting Started

Building your voice agent with ROSE is simple:

1. **Authenticate** — Secure your API calls with a bearer token.
2. **Create an Agent** — Use our `/agents` endpoints to create and manage your voice AI agents.  
3. **Connect via WebSocket** — Communicate with ROSE in real time using WebSocket connections.  
   - You can connect over **web** or **telephony** to exchange live audio streams.

## Authentication

Before making API calls, you’ll need an API key.  
You can generate one by logging in to your [AIvoco Dashboard](https://playground.aivoco.com).

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
