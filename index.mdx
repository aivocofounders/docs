## How It Works

The AIVOCO Speech-to-Speech flow is designed to be **modular** and **real-time**:

1. **Create an Agent** — Define your agent’s name, voice, and system behavior via the `/agents` API.  
2. **Connect via WebSocket** — Use our secure endpoint to establish a live speech stream between your app or telephony system and ROSE.  
3. **Integrate Telephony** — Connect with Twilio, Exotel, or any SIP trunking provider using our `wss://call.aivoco.on.cloud.vispark.in/ws/{api_key}/{agent_id}` WebSocket.  
4. **Transcribe Conversations** — Retrieve full transcripts and insights from the **Transcription endpoint** using your call ID.  

These steps are covered in detail in the [Quickstart Guide →](/quickstart)

## Authentication

Every API request requires authentication via an API key.

To generate your key:
- Log in to your [AIVOCO Playground](https://playground.aivoco.com)
- Go to your dashboard → **API Keys**
- Copy your key and include it in the `X-API-Key` header or WebSocket path

Example:
```bash
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
````
